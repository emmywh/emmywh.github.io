# Project Updates
## Week 2 Update - Emily White
### Drafting Ideas
What was accomplished in the last week?

Last week I came up with a project idea involving learning algorithms used in computational biology since I come from a molecular biology background and that may be the direction I want to take my career. Then I decided against that project in favor of increasing my confidence in coding to prepare for a future internship.

What is planned to be accomplished in the next week?

Â I need to outline the timeline for my project and come up with a specific theme for what I am creating and finish setting up my personal website.

What went well in the process/plan for the week?

I had lots of resources to look into to help me find something that would be most helpful to learn at this time.

What are some ideas for improvement in your process?

I just need to allocate more time in the week to this project at the moment.
