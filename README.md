## Week 2 Update - Emily White
### Drafting Ideas
What was accomplished in the last week?

Last week I came up with a project idea involving learning algorithms used in computational biology since I come from a molecular biology background and that may be the direction I want to take my career. Then I decided against that project in favor of increasing my confidence in coding to prepare for a future internship.

What is planned to be accomplished in the next week?

 I need to outline the timeline for my project and come up with a specific theme for what I am creating and finish setting up my personal website.

What went well in the process/plan for the week?

I had lots of resources to look into to help me find something that would be most helpful to learn at this time.

What are some ideas for improvement in your process?

I just need to allocate more time in the week to this project at the moment.



## Week 3 Update - Emily White
### Web Development Proposal
What did I do last week?

Last week set up my personal website, although it looks very plain at the moment. I chose a Udemy course to on web development to follow for the semester and finalized my project proposal.

What do you plan to do this week?

I will complete the intro and start the HTML portion of the course. My website needs a theme and purpose and that will allow me to create the HTML files for each page.

Are there any impediments in your way?

I may need adjust my coding environment and that may set me back in working on the website.

Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?

This week I spread out my time allocated for this course throughout the week, so I had a chance to walk away and come back with a clearer mind which increased my productivity. This week my workflow will shift into my project from setup, so there will be much more focused work over brainstorming. This means my work will probably be grouped into fewer larger windows of time.



## Week 4 Update - Emily White
### Setting up and Getting Started
What did I do last week?
I set up my IDE and starting working the the web development course, beginning with HTML.

What is planned for next week?
I will continue working on the course, come up with a theme for the website I will develop and personalize my website.

What went well in the process/plan for the week?
I am having trouble balancing this course with professional obligations and my other course.

What are some ideas for improvement in your process?
Blocking out time at the beginning if the week will allow me to make progress in this course before other obligations.



## Week 5 Update - Emily White
### Web Desgin Review
What did you do last week?
I watched more of the CSS section of the course. I brainstormed some website themes and looked into data that could fill my website that could potentially narrow down a theme.
What do you plan to do this week?
Pick a theme for the website and start initial designs on it.
Finish the CSS portion and start JS portion.
Are there any impediments in your way?
The only thing that may slow me down is finding a data set that I can imagine a website for.
Reflection on the process you used last week, how can you make the process work better?
Everything went well. I have the flow of the course down so I may be able to go a little faster.



## Week 6 Update - Emily White
### Halfway Through
Week 6 already! I am about halfway with my course. I am working on the JS portion after finishing the CSS module. The course is very nicely laid out and allows me to skip around. I also listen to everything at 1.5 speed, so I am making good progress. The resources they provide are direct and helpful. I decided my website would have a zoological data theme. I found a dataset about penguin populations on some islands that I can start with and possible grow the website from there. This topic will allow me to create multiple web pages with information about the species and their locations.

Next week I am unsure how much I will get done because I am in the middle of a move, but I am hoping to work on my course and potentially get some basic HTML sheets written.

My main roadblock is just getting started on the website, but once I get going it hope I don't run into any errors I can't figure out. Next week I hope to focus on my course for better than this week and explore more of the resources.



## Week 7 Update - Emily White
### Taking a Breather
Week 7! I did not get much done this week because of my move, but this week I will continue the JS portion of the course. It is the biggest and most detailed section of the course, so it will take me a while.

This project has been very unproblematic so far so no roadblocks at this time.



## Week 8 Update - Emily White
### Let me out of JS World
This week I working on the JS portion of my course some more. I believe I am about 80% through. The next sections are much smaller in comparison. In the following week, I would like to push further through the course and potentially start the website since I have thought more about how I want to organize it. 

Nothing is blocking me at this time. The course is a lot to get through and at some point I will start to forget what I learned at the beginning, so starting the website now would be good, so I can utilize what I learned earlier before it gets buried. Although it is bulky I am really enjoying the JS React portion of this course and am excited to use my knowledge in future projects.



## Week 9 Update - Emily White
### Perfectionism
Whew! Week 9 came with a bit of restructuring for me. I continued watching course materials, but I realize I would rather learn more things from the course than make a "perfect" website. Making a website I am happy with in a limited time frame is a bit more pressure than I would like to have on myself. To solve this problem I am going to adjust my goal to create a bare bones "skeleton" website that I can build on after the course as I apply to internships. This course will help me accomplish the hard part, which is starting. Then, I can more features in the future. I have my data and website design completed, all I have to do is start!



## Week 10 Update - Emily White
### Is Hosting a Website Complicated?
Last week was more coursework and more coursework. Yesterday I learned how to host my website on Github. This week will be setting up my website and potentially getting some static pages up. My main blocker for this project is running into problems that I have no background in a have no idea how to fix, mainly for working in IDEs. Tediously figuring things out has been the main time sink for this project. Therefore, I hope setting up this website is fairly straight forward.



## Week 11 Update - Emily White
### Creative Static
Last week I wasn't as productive as I would've hoped. I wanted to upload my html files to github but I decided to reconfigure them over the weekend and do not have them ready to go again yet. Unsurprisingly I continued to watch morfe content from the course. I have already completed the core lessons of each module in the course, but the more in depth videos are really interesting. This week I will upload my html files to github, hopefully with some CSS. I am feeling the strain of the end of the semester, so I am keeping my expectations low for myself. I am simply being finicky with my website. I wish I had more time to create something that focused more on my interests, but my focused interest on that would take me out fo the time confines of the course. The thing holding me up is being uninspired and picky, which is something I will take over technical difficulties.
